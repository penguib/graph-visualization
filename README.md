# Graph visualization

## About
This project is to visualize an algorithm that combines two graphs and finds the shortest path in the conflated graph between the first (red) and last vertices in the latter (blue) graph. 

## Controls
| Key | Action |
| --- | ----- |
| Left Arrow | Switch to the first graph `default` |
| Right Arrow | Switch to the second graph |
| Enter | Combine graphs and find the shortest path |
| Backspace | Clear graphs |

To connect a vertex to another, you need to click the vertex you want to connect and then click anywhere on the canvas for the second vertex.
